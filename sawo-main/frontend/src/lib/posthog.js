/**
 * lib/posthog.js
 *
 * PostHog, scoped deliberately to session replay, heatmaps/clickmaps, and
 * (future) funnel events. NOT pageviews, NOT geo — the patched first-party
 * tracker (local-storage/track.js -> backend/trackingApi.js ->
 * analytics_page_views) already owns those, so capture_pageview stays off
 * here regardless of anything else, to keep the two systems from doubling up.
 *
 * autocapture IS on (unlike the original session-replay-only setup) — it's
 * required for PostHog's Clickmap ("most-clicked buttons") breakdown, not
 * just the visual mouse-heatmap overlay (enable_heatmaps alone would cover
 * that). This means every click/form interaction is now a billed
 * $autocapture event against PostHog's event quota — deliberate trade-off,
 * not an oversight.
 *
 * Gated the same way as the first-party tracker: production only, admins
 * excluded, /admin and /login excluded — admins must never appear in
 * session replay or heatmap/click data.
